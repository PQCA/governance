*\[Link to original project proposal\]*

 *\[Link to signed project charter\]*

 *\[Link to signed contribution agreement\]*

This is an issue created to help onboard your project into PQCA after the TAC has voted to accept your project.

This document lists tasks that maintainers need to do to onboard a new project to PQCA. PQCA staff are here and happy to help with these. Please reach out to [projects@pqca.org](mailto:projects@pqca.org) with any questions.

Please track your progress by using "Quote reply" to create your own copy of this checklist in the issue, so that you can update the status as you finish items.

**REQUIRED BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH ONBOARDING**

- [ ] A "Project Contribution Agreement" must be completed and any existing trademarks MUST be transferred to the Linux Foundation BEFORE the PQCA staff onboarding tasks can be completed. Other tasks can be done by projects themselves in the meantime.  
- [ ] Confirm project name.  
      *Note that many tasks require having a project name picked out, so sorting out branding should be a priority.

### **Marketing tasks:**

- [ ] Draft a [blog post](https://pqca.org/blog/) announcing your project and describe what the project is, why it is being open sourced and how people can get involved.  
- [ ] **Optional:** [Book time with PQCA staff](https://meetings.hubspot.com/christina-harter/pqca-project-onboarding-call) to understand project benefits and event resources or ask other questions.

### **Infrastructure Tasks:**

Please work with PQCA staff to: 

- [ ] Move your project to a PQCA hosted Github organization.  
- [ ] Accept the invite to join the PQCA GitHub Enterprise account.   
      * PQCA staff will create a new organization for the project under the PQCA Github Enterprise account and move any existing repositories into this new organization.   
      * We'll then add thelinuxfoundation as an organization owner to ensure neutral hosting of your project.  
- [ ] **Optional:** Set up [Discord channel(s)](https://discord.com/channels/1202723482224295936/1214569223012089878). Confirm channels needed (announce, project contributors, etc.) and who should have admin privileges.  
- [ ] **Optional:** Set up [public project calls](https://pqca.org/calendar/) . Confirm date/time, meeting cadence and who should have host privileges. 
- [ ] **Optional:** Set up [a mailing list](https://lists.pqca.org/groups) as a way to communicate to your TSC and other project community members.

### **Governance Tasks:**

- [ ] Form the Technical Steering Committee (TSC).
   -  [ ] Review signed project charter to review TSC requirements, responsibilities and voting guidelines.
   -  [ ] Send the name(s) and email(s) of all TSC members to PQCA staff via email at [projects@pqca.org](mailto:projects@pqca.org) .
   - [ ] **Optional, but highly recommended:** Work with PQCA staff to set up recurring TSC calls. Confirm date/time and meeting cadence.
